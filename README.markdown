## LOLTranslate - Javascript based LOLCat Translator
---

#### Usage:

Include this file in your project source and now you can translate a string
to LolSpeak like so  

		var catSays = LOLTranslate('Hello World'); // outputs 'oh hai whirld'

You can pass a second optional paramater true | false to make the output
all uppercased:  

		var catSays = LOLTranslate('Hello World', true); // outputs 'OH HAI WURRLD'

that's about it... have fun!
